"""API for rule-based entity marking.

This module contains the top-level methods for applying annotation rules to a corpus.

To see how this fits among all the modules of this package, see
`tf.browser.ner.annotate` .

# Programmatic annotation done in a Jupyter Notebook

If you have a spreadsheet with named entities, and for each entity a list of surface forms,
then this module takes care to read that spreadsheet, translate it to YAML,
and then use the YAML as instructions to add entity annotations to the corpus.

See this
[example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HuygensING/suriano/blob/main/programs/ner.ipynb).

Here are more details.

## Starting up

Load the relevant Python modules:

``` python
from tf.app import use
```

Load your corpus. There are two ways:

*   Work with a local GitHub clone of the corpus in `~/HuygensING/suriano`:

        A = use("HuygensING/suriano:clone", checkout="clone")

*   Or let TF auto-download the latest version and work with that:

        A = use("HuygensING/suriano")

Load the `Ner` module:

``` python
NE = A.makeNer()
```

The tool expects some input data to be present: configuration and spreadsheets with
instructions. They can be found in the `ner` directory.
If you work with a local GitHub clone, that data resides in
`~/github/HuygensING/suriano`
and if you work with an auto-downloaded copy of the data, it is in
`~/text-fabric-data/github/HuygensING/suriano`.

The output data of the tool ends up in the `_temp` directory, which ends up next
to the `ner` directory.

## The entity spreadsheets

Here is an example:

![browser](../../images/Annotate/spreadsheet.png)

In our example, the name of the spreadsheet containing this information is
`people.xlsx` and it can be found as `ner/sheets/people.xlsx`

The spreadsheet will be read as follows:

*   the first two rows will be skipped
*   after that, each row is taken to describe exactly one entity
*   the first column has the full and unique name for that entity
*   the second column contains the kind of the entity (you may choose your
    keywords freely for this)
*   the third column contains a number of surface forms for this entity,
    separated by `;`
*   when the surface forms are peeled out, leading and trailing white-space will be
    stripped
*   all other columns will be ignored for the moment; in later versions we may use
    the information in those columns to fill in extra data about the entities;
    but probably that information will not end up in TF features.

During translation from XLSX to YAML the following happens:

*   An identifier is distilled from the name of the entity;
*   Missing kind fields are filled with the default kind.

These steps need some configuration information from the `ner/config.yaml` file.

Translation is done by

``` python
NE.readInstructions("people")
```

The resulting YAML ends up next to the
spreadsheet, and it looks like this:

``` yaml
christoffel.sticke:
  kind: PER
  name: Christoffel Sticke
  occSpecs: []
diederik.sticke:
  kind: PER
  name: Diederik Sticke
  occSpecs:
  - Dierck
  - Dirk
dirck.hartog:
  kind: PER
  name: Dirck Hartog
  occSpecs:
  - Dirich Hartocson
  - Hertocson
jan.baptist.roelants:
  kind: PER
  name: Jan-Baptist Roelants
  occSpecs:
  - Roelans
  - Rolans
```

## Inventory

A first step is to find out how many occurrences we find in the corpus for these
surface forms:

``` python
NE.makeInventory()
NE.showInventory()
```

and the output looks like this

```
...

cornelis.adriaensz       PER   Pach                     7 x Cornelis Adriaensz. Pack
david.marlot             PER   Morlot                   1 x David de Marlot
erick.dimmer             PER   Dimer                   11 x Erick Dimmer
erycius.puteanus         PER   Potiano                  2 x Erycius Puteanus
francesco.giustiniani    PER   Giustiniano             11 x Francesco Giustiniani
francois.doubleth        PER   Doublet                  2 x FranÃ§ois Doubleth

...

Total 150
```

Entities that are in the spreadsheet, but not in the corpus are skipped.

## Marking up

In order to create annotations for these entities, we have to switch to an
annotation set. Let's start a new set and give it the name `power`.

``` python
NE.setSet("power")
```

If it turns out that `power` has already annotations, and you want to clear them, say

``` python
NE.resetSet("power")
```

Now we are ready for the big thing: creating the annotations:

``` python
NE.markEntities()
```

It outputs this message:

```
Already present:     0 x
Added:             150 x
```

## Inspection

We now revert to lower-level methods from the `tf.browser.ner.annotate` class to
inspect some of the results.

``` python
results = NE.filterContent(bFind="pach", bFindC=False, anyEnt=True, showStats=None)
```

Here we filtered the chunks (paragraphs) to those that contain the string `pach`,
in a case-insensitive way, and that contain at least one entity.

There 6 of them, and we can show them:

``` python
NE.showContent(results)
```

![browser](../../images/Annotate/pach.png)

The resulting entities are in `_temp/power/entities.tsv` and look like this:

```
erick.dimmer	PER	160196
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	142613
gaspar.iii.coligny	PER	7877
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	210499
john.vere	PER	94659
antonio.lando	PER	267755
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	107069
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	9162
michiel.pagani	PER	94366
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	179208
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	258933
hans.meinhard	PER	75039

...
```

Each line corresponds to a marked entity occurrence.
Lines consist of tab separated fields:

*   entity identifier
*   entity kind
*   remaining fields: slots, i.e. the textual positions occupied by the occurrence.
    Some entity occurrences consist of multiple words / tokens, hence have multiple
    slots.
