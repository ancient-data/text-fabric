## 11

### 11.0

### 11.0.1

2022-11-18

Small fixes: the newest version of the
[pygithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
module issues slightly different errors.
Text-Fabric did not catch some of them, and went on after failures,
which led to unspeakable and incomprehensible further errors.
That has been fixed. 

As a consequence, we require the now newest release of that module,
which in turns requires a Python version of at least 3.7.0.

So we have bumped the Python requirement for Text-Fabric from 3.6.3 to 3.7.0.

### 11.0.0

2022-11-11

Text-Fabric can be installed with different capabilities.

On some platforms not all requirements for Text-Fabric can be met, e.g.
the Github or GitLab backends, or the Text-Fabric browser.

You can now install a bare Text-Fabric, without those capabilities,
or a more capable Text-Fabric with additional capabilities.

Text-Fabric will detect what its capabilities are, and issue warnings
if it asked to do tasks for which it lacks the capabilities.

See more in `tf.about.install`.
