## 11

### 11.0

### 11.0.3

2022-12-13 (upcoming)

Small fixes for problems encountered when using gitlab backends.

### 11.0.2

2022-12-04

Text-Fabric will detect if it runs on an iPad.
On an iPad the home directory `~` is not writable.
In that case, Text-Fabric will use `~/Documents` instead of `~`
consistently.

When Text-Fabric reports filenames on the interface, it always *unexpanduser*s
it, so that it does not reveal the location of your home directory.

Normally, it replaces your home directory by `~`, but on iPad it replaces
*your home directory*`/Documents` by `~`.

So if you publish notebooks made on an iPad or made on a computer,
there is no difference in the reported file names.

### 11.0.1

2022-11-18

Small fixes: the newest version of the
[pygithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
module issues slightly different errors.
Text-Fabric did not catch some of them, and went on after failures,
which led to unspeakable and incomprehensible further errors.
That has been fixed. 

As a consequence, we require the now newest release of that module,
which in turns requires a Python version of at least 3.7.0.

So we have bumped the Python requirement for Text-Fabric from 3.6.3 to 3.7.0.

### 11.0.0

2022-11-11

Text-Fabric can be installed with different capabilities.

On some platforms not all requirements for Text-Fabric can be met, e.g.
the Github or GitLab backends, or the Text-Fabric browser.

You can now install a bare Text-Fabric, without those capabilities,
or a more capable Text-Fabric with additional capabilities.

Text-Fabric will detect what its capabilities are, and issue warnings
if it asked to do tasks for which it lacks the capabilities.

See more in `tf.about.install`.
