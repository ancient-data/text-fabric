# Corpora

Corpora are usually stored in an online repository, such as GitHub or a research data archive
such as [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/front-page?set_language=en).

Some corpora are supported by Text-Fabric *apps*.

These apps provide a browser interface for the corpus, and they enhance the API for working
with them programmatically.

A TF app can also download and update the corpus *data*.

All existing apps can be found in 
[annotation](https://github.com/annotation) on GitHub.
Each repo named `app-`*appName* hosts the app named *appName*.


Corpora prefixed with a star do not have dedicated TF apps.

## Get corpora

### Automatically

Text-Fabric downloads apps from [annotation](https://github.com/annotation) automatically
when you use them.

See `tf.about.use`.

Data ends up in a logical place under your `~/text-fabric-data/`.

The TF data is fairly compact.

!!! caution "Size of data"
    There might be sizable additional data for some corpora,
    images for example.
    In that case, take care to have a good internet connection
    when you use a TF app for the first time.

### Manually

Corpus data of app-supported corpora reside in a GitHub repo.
You can manually clone such a data repository and point Text-Fabric to that data.

First, take care that your clone ends up in `github/`*orgName*
(relative your home directory)
where *orgName* is the organization or person on GitHub under which you have
found the repo.

Then, when you invoke the app, pass the specifier `:clone`.
This instructs Text-Fabric to look in your local GitHub clone, rather
than online or in `text-fabric-data`, where downloaded data is stored.

    use('org/repo:clone', checkout="clone")

    text-fabric org/repo:clone --checkout=clone

In this way, you can work with data that is under your control.

!!! caution "Size of data"
    Cloning a data repository is more costly then letting Text-Fabric download the data.
    A data repository may contain several versions and representations of the data,
    including the their change histories. There might also be other
    material in the repo, such as source data, tutorials, programs.

    For example, the `etcbc/bhsa` repo is several GB, but the TF data for a specific
    version is only 25MB.

### Extra data

Researchers are continually adding new insights in the form of new feature
data. TF apps make it easy to use that data alongside the main data source.
Read more about the data life cycle in `tf.about.datasharing`.
