"""Named Entity Recognition by Triggers.

As a preparation, read `tf.about.annotate` first, since it explains the concepts, and
guides you to set up the configuration for your corpus.

We explain here how to work with entity spreadsheets.

In a spreadsheet you can assign *triggers* to entities.
Triggers are strings to search for in the corpus.
You can limit the scope of these triggers to specific portions in the corpus.

The specification of the content and organization of such a entity sheet is in
`tf.ner.sheets.Sheets.readSheetData()`.

You can place entity sheets in the directory `ner/specs` at the toplevel of the repo,
or, if you are not working from the repo, you can look up the corpus
under your `text-fabric-data` directory, and find a `ner` directory there.

The output data of the tool ends up in the `_temp` directory, which ends up next
to the `ner` directory.

## For corpus designers

If you are a corpus designer, you can declare this `ner` directory as an extra
data module. Then it will packaged with the TF dataset of your corpus, and users
that use your corpus also get this directory, and can work with the NER tool
in the TF browser.

The way to declare this `ner` data module is by making sure that `app/config.yaml`
has this:

```
provenanceSpec:
    ...
    extraData: ner
    ...
```

Additionally, you can create a file `ner/config.yaml` with some settings for the
NER process. See `tf.ner.settings.Settings`.

You can also put a file `code.py` there in which you implement the function
`normalizeChars(string): string`

If you implement it, it will be invoked as a text transformation function upon
reading string data from spreadsheets.
The idea is that if the corpus is normalized for certain characters,
you can normalize the search terms and names in the spreadsheet in the
same way. For example, in the Suriano corpus, all incarnations of an
apostrophe, such as `‚Äô` or `'` or `‚Äò` have been normalized to `‚Äô`.
But the spreadsheet might still use the unwanted the variants.
By providing a suitable function you can prevent that.

## Starting up

### In the TF browser

On the command line say:

```
tf org/repo --tool=ner
```

If you are at the top level of the repo, you can even say

```
tf --tool=ner
```

Then use the chooser at the top right of the interface to select an annotation
set. There are three kinds of sets:

*   **=** The (readonly) set of entities that are already baked in into the TF dataset;
*   **üßæ** (readonly) sets of entities defined by a spreadsheet;
*   **üñçÔ∏è** (mutable) sets of entities created manually by the user with the NER tool
    in the TF browser.

![browser](../../images/Ner/select2.png)

### In a program

Import the relevant Python modules:

``` python
from tf.app import use
```

Load your corpus. There are two ways:

*   Work with a local GitHub clone of the corpus in `~/HuygensING/suriano`:

        A = use("HuygensING/suriano:clone", checkout="clone")

*   Or let TF auto-download the latest version and work with that:

        A = use("HuygensING/suriano")

Load the `Ner` module:

``` python
NE = A.makeNer()
```

You can now load a spreadsheet by

``` python
NE.setTask(".people")
```

**N.B.:** The leading `.` in the name signifies that this set is coupled with a
spreadsheet.

## Trigger investigations

We now assume that you are working with a program, ideally in a Jupyter notebook.

There are a few rule in trigger based entity search:

*   the corpus is searched from beginning to end;
*   if at some place in the corpus multiple triggers match, the longest match
    counts, and the others are discarded;
*   if at some place, a trigger has matched, searching continues past the end of
    the match.

A consequence of these rules is that at no token in the corpus is part of a double
match.

The idea behind this is that if you have two triggers, that the more specific trigger
takes precedence above the lesser specific one.

However, the rules also have some pitfalls, which can lead to triggers that
have unexpectedly no results, or less results than expected.

Here are a few caveats:

*   Overlapping triggers: if you have the following triggers:

    *   `the mayor`
    *   `mayor of London`

    then the second one looks more specific than the first one. but if you have this
    passage in the corpus:

    `the mayor of London`

    then `mayor of London` will not be found. Because before it can be found,
    `the mayor` will be found, after which searching continues at `of London`, and
    this does not match the trigger `mayor of London`.

    The solution to cases like this is: `the mayor` is a rather generic trigger, and
    it will only be valid in specific spots in the corpus.

    So add a scope to this trigger, and make sure that `the mayor of London` is outside
    that scope.

When the entity spreadsheet is big, with over a thousand triggers for hundreds of names,
it is difficult to keep track of all the tricky interactions between triggers.

For that reason we have a few diagnostic functions that help you to spot them:

*   `tf.ner.ner.Ner.triggerInterference()` will list the triggers belonging to
    different entities that overlap and for which there are occurrences where this
    overlap is problematic;

*   `tf.ner.ner.Ner.reportHits()` will list the triggers without hits while they do
    occur in the corpus; it will give diagnostic info about those triggers; it also
    produces statistics about the inventory of entities that has been collected on the
    basis of the triggers; finally it produces a file that lists the number of hits
    per entity, per trigger, per scope and per section where the occurrences have
    been found.

    This class is the central class of the trigger based Named Entity
    Recognition tool whose main task is to find occurrences of annotations on
    the basis of criteria.

    This class inherits from a number of other classes:

    *   `tf.ner.sheets`: manage annotation spreadsheets;
    *   `tf.ner.sets`: manage annotation sets;
    *   `tf.ner.show`: generate HTML for annotated buckets of the corpus;

    In turn, these classes inherit from yet other classes:

    *   `tf.ner.sets` from `tf.ner.data`: manage the annotation data in various
        convenient representations;
    *   `tf.ner.data` from `tf.ner.corpus`: manage the corpus dependent bits; it uses
        the TF machinery to extract the specifics of the corpus;
    *   `tf.ner.corpus` from `tf.ner.settings`: additional settings, some of which
        derive from a config file;
    *   `tf.ner.sheets` from:

        *   `tf.ner.scopes`: support the concept of scope in the corpus;
        *   `tf.ner.triggers`: support the concept of trigger;

    The NER machinery can be used by

    *   users to manipulate annotations in their own programs, especially in a
        Jupyter notebook.
    *   `tf.browser.ner.web`: Flask app that routes URLs to controller functions.

    The browsing experience is supported by:

    *   `tf.browser.ner.web`: map urls to the controllers of the web app
    *   `tf.browser.ner.serve`: implement the controllers of the web app
    *   `tf.browser.ner.request`: manage the data of a request;
    *   `tf.browser.ner.form`: retrieve form values into typed and structured values.
    *   `tf.browser.ner.fragments`: generate HTML for widgets on the page;
    *   `tf.browser.ner.websettings`: settings for the browser experience;
    *   `tf.browser.html`: a generic library to generate HTML using Pythonic syntax.

        of buckets, or a subset of buckets, namely those contained in a
        particular node, see parameters `node`, and `buckets`.

        **Bucket filtering**

        The parameters `bFind`, `bFindC`, `bFindRe`  specify a regular expression
        search on the texts of the buckets.

        The positions of the found occurrences is included in the result.

        The parameter `anyEnt` is a filter on the presence or absence of entities in
        buckets in general.

        **Entity filtering**

        The parameter `eVals` holds the values of a specific entity to look for.

        **Occurrence filtering**

        The parameter `qTokens` is a sequence of tokens to look for.
        The occurrences that are found, can be filtered further by `valSelect`
        and `freeState`.

        In entity filtering and occurrence filtering, the matching occurrences
        are included in the result.

        Parameters
        ----------
        buckets: set of integer, optional None
            The set of buckets to filter, instead of the whole corpus.
            Works also if the parameter `node` is specified, which also restricts
            the buckets to filter. If both are specified, their effect will be
            combined.
        node: integer, optional None
            Gets the context of the node, typically the intermediate-level section
            in which the node occurs. Then restricts the filtering to the buckets
            contained in the context, instead of the whole corpus.
        bFind: string, optional None
            A search pattern that filters the buckets, before applying the search
            for a token sequence.
        bFindC: string, optional None
            Whether the search is case sensitive or not.
        bFindRe: object, optional None
            A compiled regular expression.
            This function searches on `bFindRe`, but if it is None, it compiles
            `bFind` as regular expression and searches on that. If `bFind` itself
            is not None, of course.
        anyEnt: boolean, optional None
            If True, it wants all buckets that contain at least one already
            marked entity; if False, it wants all buckets that do not contain any
            already marked entity.
        eVals: tuple, optional None
            A sequence of values corresponding with the entity features `eid`
            and `kind`. If given, the function wants buckets that contain at least
            an entity with those properties.
        trigger: string, optional None
            If given, the function wants buckets that contain at least an
            entity that is triggered by this string. The entity in question must
            be the one given by the parameter `evals`.
        qTokens: tuple, optional None
            A sequence of tokens whose occurrences in the corpus will be looked up.
        valSelect: dict, optional None
            If present, the keys are the entity features (`eid` and `kind`),
            and the values are iterables of values that are allowed.

            The feature values to filter on.
            The results of searching for `eVals` or `qTokens` are filtered further.
            If a result is also an instance of an already marked entity,
            the properties of that entity will be compared feature by feature with
            the allowed values that `valSelect` specifies for that feature.
        freeState: boolean, optional None
            If True, found occurrences may not intersect with already marked up
            features.
            If False, found occurrences must intersect with already marked up features.
        showStats: boolean, optional None
            Whether to show statistics of the find.
            If None, it only shows gross totals, if False, it shows nothing,
            if True, it shows totals by feature.

        Returns
        -------
        list of tuples
            For each bucket that passes the filter, a tuple with the following
            members is added to the list:

            *   the TF node of the bucket;
            *   tokens: the tokens of the bucket, each token is a tuple consisting
                of the TF slot of the token and its string value;
            *   matches: the match positions of the found occurrences or entity;
            *   positions: the token positions of where the text of the bucket
                starts matching the `bFindRe`;

            If `browse` is True, also some stats are passed next to the list
            of results.
